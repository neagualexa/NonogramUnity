        "Start with row 8, which has 10 consecutive filled cells; fill it completely.",
        "In row 10, you can fill the first 6 cells and leave the rest unfilled.",
        "Since row 8 is fully filled, examine its intersections with columns 5 to 9, and adjust them accordingly.",
        "Row 6 has 6 consecutive filled cells; you can fill them starting from the left edge of the grid.",
        "Column 5 has a sequence of 8 consecutive filled cells; start filling from the bottom and move up.",
        "Once you've filled column 5, look at how it intersects with rows 4 to 6, and adjust the corresponding cells.",
        "Check the intersection between column 5 and row 10; this can confirm your earlier fills.",
        "The right side of the grid, particularly in rows 3 to 6, contains several filled cells. This could help you complete columns 5 through 10 in this region.",
        "The bottom half of the puzzle, especially rows 6 and 10, has large blocks of filled cells, which can be extended horizontally to confirm surrounding rows' patterns.",
        "In the center of the puzzle, focus on column 5, which has the longest continuous block. Filling this column provides a reference point to infer adjacent columns.",
        "The top right quadrant has fewer filled cells, suggesting that clues with smaller sequences should be used carefully to avoid contradictions."
