        "The puzzle is symmetrical, so you can use the filled squares in one half to deduce the corresponding squares in the other half.",
        "Start with rows that have the maximum number of filled cells, as these are easier to complete.",
        "Look at the middle area of rows 3-6; these rows have consecutive filled cells, making them easy to complete.",
        "Columns 3 through 8 should be completely filled between rows 3 and 6, as they contain a sequence of 8 cells each.",
        "There should be at least one empty cell between the two filled blocks in row 2, leaving room for interpretation.",
        "Since column 2 contains 6 consecutive filled cells, focus on filling rows 2-7 in this column.",
        "Row 1 has gaps between the filled cells, so start filling the cells that have definite spaces.",
        "Given that row 3 is entirely filled, examine how this affects the consecutive filled cell pattern for other columns."
